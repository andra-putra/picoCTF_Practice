# PicoCTF PicoGYM Solutions

> **⚠️ SPOILER ALERT**  
> This repository contains my solutions to problems from the PicoCTF competition. If you're practicing and want to solve the problems on your own, I'd recommend not looking at my solutions.

## About

This repository contains the scripts and solutions I created while practigin the [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) training program named picoGym. The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and to share my solutions and learnings with others who are interested in cybersecurity and CTF competitions.

## How to Use

The challenges are organized into directories. Each directory is named after a challenge and contains a script or text file about the solution for the challenge, along with any other files related to the challenge.

## Contributions
